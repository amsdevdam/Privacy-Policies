### User Data

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that this app is not programmed to collect, use or share any personal information regarding the user. All data created by the user is stored locally, on the user's device. I do not have any access to the user generated data (like created Notes, Reminders, etc.)

### Permissions

You can find below the permissions requested by the app and the reasons why they are required.

<br/>

| Permission | Usage |
| :---: | --- |
| 'android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM' | This permission is required for the app to be able to set alarms for the Reminder feature. |
| 'android.permission.VIBRATE' | This permission is required to vibrate the device when the reminder alarm fires. |
| 'android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE' | This permission is used to create the alarm notification which through the user can interact with the app and turn off the ringing alarm |
| 'android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED' | This permission is required for the app to be able to detect when the device reboot is complete. It is needed because the created alarms are cancelled by the system when the device is turned off. It is used to be able to recreate the alarms after reboot. |
